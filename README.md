# Notes Taker App

## The app was built to further strengthen my understanding of the Android Studio, Android Framework, Java, XML, SQL, and Google Firebase. 

This app purpose is to serve as a digital "notebook" for users. It allow user to take note their various important matter digitally without relying much on the physical book. As the note is backed up by database, user's note are safe and secure. They can also access it from any device in any place. 

The project is perfect opportunity for me to implement skills such as;

* create a functioning android mobile application similar to the one exists in the market
* create a comprehensive and reliable app that is well integreted with Google Firebase
* create an app that help to ease user daily life, and act as their "second brain"
